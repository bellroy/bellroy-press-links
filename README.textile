h1. Bellroy Press Links

This repository contains a list of links used by nRelate (and possibly other advertising services) which are delivered via an RSS feed.

The services are given the raw file URL to rss.xml.

h2. Getting started

* check out the repository from Git
* Run bundle install

h2. Adding links

* edit the rss.xml.haml file, adding the links you want in a new item block
* Run haml against the rss.xml file (haml rss.xml.haml rss.xml)
* Push the changed files to Github

h2. Todo

* Use the Outbrain links as definitive list of links
* Use git hooks to run the haml utility when pushed
* check if I can use separate channels for different advertisers
